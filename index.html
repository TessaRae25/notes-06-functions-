        <h1>Functions in Javascript</h1>
            
            <p>Functions are important and valuable tools in programming. They are used to encapsulate and create reusable code. There are a number of ways to create functions in Javascript, the most common wat is by using the function keyword. After you have created a function, you must 'invoke' or 'call'  it in order to run the code that it contains.</p>

            <p id="function1"></p>

            <h1>Scoping Global and Local</h1>

            <p>Scoping is the concept where your variables can be accessed.  There are two major scopes. Global and Local.  Global Scope variables are those that exist <strong>outside</strong> of loops, functions, objects, etc.  Local Scope variables are that that exist <strong>inside</strong> of loops, functions, objects, etc.</p>

            <p>Global Scope also means that variables can be used by anything outside of your code. As a result, they can be overwritten. Global Scope variables are not recommended for sensitive data, such as user information, password or anything that should be kept secret.</p>

            <p id="scope1"></p>

            <p>Global Scope variables are typically declared in the main document and outside any functions or objects. They are, therefore, accessible by all functions in the document. However, they run the risk of being overwritten, may create security loopholes and cause some code efficiency problems.</p>

            <p id="scope2"></p>

            <p>Local Scope variables are declared inside of a function or object, etc. They are only accessible by their parent element that they are declared inside of.  These local variables run less risk of being overwritten because you must first reach into the function to acces them. In modern, standards-compliant Javascript, it is highly recommended to work mostly in local scope variables.</p>

            <h1>Passing Arguments</h1>

            <p>When a function is able to take in arguments, you can use those arguments to perform actions specific to the function. This is referred to as, 'passing an argument to the function'. Most of the time, you pass arguments into a function in order for them to be ised in some way. After use, the result is typically returned to that elements outside of the function can use the returned value.</p>

            <p id="arguments"></p>

            <p>Passing arguments is a very common programmin technique. It can be used for calculations as simple as adding two numbers, or as complex as equations.</p>

            <p id="modulus"></p>

            <h1>Conditionals and Functions</h1>

            <p>Functions can run more complex operations suc as loops and conditionals.</p>
